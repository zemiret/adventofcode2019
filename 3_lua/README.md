# Thoughts

A rather naive approach completes this task in O(n * k) time, where
	* n - number of "turns" (length of input sequence)
	* k - average length from one turn to another 

I'm pretty sure it can be done in O(nlogn) using *interval trees*.

Also, Lua. I can't believe that arrays are so tedious to work with,
there are no hash maps, and no value unpacking.
I'm pretty sure there are actually some tricks to make that work nicer.
