# Thoughts

This was the first time I've ever written anything in Go.
This languge feels like writing in C but it "flows".
In C you (I at least sometimes) feel like a bulldozer on a minefield, and here
it's more like a fairy on a very nice meadow.

This solution is really more of a laziness than a need, because I feel this could be 
computed with pen and paper by someone skilled in combinatorics in 2 minutes.
